I did the voodoo docker multi-architecture support song and dance "buildx"

I thne went and copied all the opencv dependencies from this containers image from: /usr/local/lib/

I then created a file called /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf and wrote to it the path to the folder where the binary is stored. For example, I wrote /usr/local/lib/ to my opencv.conf file.

Note I had to like create that .conf file.

Once that was done we hit it with: ldconfig -v

I then went and installed libgtk2.0-0 to the container

Then I repeated the same steps above for the missing dependency libdc1394

I then repeated this step for 5 hours straight, recompiling our zip, sending it to the server and then bouncing it back off to the virtualization PI and running it in our docker instance. For 5 hours.
